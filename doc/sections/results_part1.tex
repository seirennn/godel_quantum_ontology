\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}
The quantum simulation was conducted with the following parameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Number of qubits: 5
    \item Circuit depth: 3
    \item Number of measurements: 1000
    \item Quantum backend: Qiskit AerSimulator
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Quantum Measurements}

\subsubsection{System Stability Metrics}
Our measurements revealed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Entropy: $S(\rho) = 4.971$ (indicating high quantum uncertainty)
    \item Coherence: $C(\rho) = -0.912$ (showing weak state preservation)
    \item Dependency Strength: $D = 0.488$ (demonstrating significant causal connections)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Normalized Scores}
The metrics were normalized to [0,1] scale:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Entropy Score: 0.994 (99.4\% of maximum instability)
    \item Coherence Score: 0.912 (91.2\% dependency on external factors)
    \item Dependency Score: 0.488 (48.8\% causal interconnection)
\end{itemize}
