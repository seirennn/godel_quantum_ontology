\section{Introduction}

\subsection{The Leibnizian Contingency Argument}
The Leibnizian Contingency Argument for God's existence is one of the most compelling classical arguments in philosophical theology. It can be formalized as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Everything that exists has an explanation of its existence, either in the necessity of its own nature or in an external cause.
    \item If the universe has an explanation of its existence, that explanation is God.
    \item The universe exists.
    \item Therefore, the universe has an explanation of its existence (from 1 and 3).
    \item Therefore, the explanation of the universe's existence is God (from 2 and 4).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Quantum Mechanical Approach}
While this argument has traditionally been explored through philosophical reasoning, we propose a novel approach using quantum computation. Our method translates the concept of contingency into quantum mechanical terms:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Contingency} $\rightarrow$ Quantum state dependency and entanglement
    \item \textbf{Causal chains} $\rightarrow$ Quantum circuit depth and connectivity
    \item \textbf{Necessity} $\rightarrow$ Quantum state stability and coherence
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Research Objectives}
This research aims to:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Develop a quantum computational model of contingent reality
    \item Analyze the stability characteristics of purely contingent systems
    \item Investigate whether such systems require a necessary foundation
    \item Provide empirical support for the Leibnizian argument
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Technical Innovation}
Our approach combines several cutting-edge fields:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Quantum Computing:} Using IBM's Qiskit framework for quantum circuit implementation
    \item \textbf{Modal Logic:} Implementing Kripke semantics for necessity analysis
    \item \textbf{Information Theory:} Analyzing quantum entropy and coherence
    \item \textbf{Statistical Analysis:} Evaluating system stability and dependency patterns
\end{itemize}
