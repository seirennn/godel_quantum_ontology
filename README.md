# Ontological Necessity and Transcendental Computability: A Quantum-Computational Formalization of Divine Existence

This project implements a quantum computational approach to exploring the necessity of a self-existent being (God) through the simulation and analysis of reality's fundamental structure using quantum mechanics, modal logic, and mathematical formalism.

## Overview

Ontological Necessity and Transcendental Computability merges quantum mechanics, computational physics, and mathematical logic to create a cutting-edge proof that explores whether reality can emerge from purely contingent causes or requires a necessary being. It uses quantum computing to simulate the fundamental structure of reality and test whether a purely materialist view is computationally possible.

### Key Components

1. **Quantum Simulation**
   - Quantum circuit implementation using Qiskit
   - Entanglement patterns representing causal dependencies

   - Analysis of necessity and contingency
   - Formal logical verification

3. **Mathematical Framework**
   - Lambda calculus for formal reasoning
   - Quantum state evolution
   - Statistical analysis of results
